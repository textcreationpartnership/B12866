            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Kings most Excellent Maiestie, obseruing that in the times of</hi> dearth, His louing Subiects, (especially the poorer sort,) are pinched with the great want and deere prices of Corne, and that the Treasure of the Kingdome, in those times is much exhausted, in prouiding of Corne from forraine parts; and againe, that in the times of plenty, the Farmour and Husbandman, by the low prices, and want of vent of their Corne, are hardly able to support their necessary charge, nor the Landlord to vphold his rent: And foreseeing, as well by reason, as by the example of forraine Nations, that these things may not onely in some good measure bee reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, but also diuers benefits procured vnto the Common wealth, (as the increase of Tillage, better venting of Our natiue commodities, strength to Our Shipping, and breeding of many Mariners) by erecting Magazins of Corne, which in times of scarcitie, may serue to keepe downe the price of forraine Corne, and in times of plentie, may keepe vp the price of Our home Corne, at such reasonable rates, as will well mainetaine the Husbandmans labour, and hold vp the Gentlemans rents: Hath commanded the Lords of his Maiesties priuie Counsaile, not onely to take the same into their owne serious consideration, but to vnderstand the opinion of diuers Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of qualitie and knowledge, and of the ablest, &amp; best experienced Merchants: All which hauing beene carefully, and effectually performed, His Maiestie, vpon deliberate aduice with his priuie Counsaile, hath resolued, and doeth hereby signifie his Royall pleasure, that Magazins of Corne shall, and may bee erected, by such Merchants and others, as shall be willing to aduenture therein, in the Ports, and places hereafter mentioned: That is to say, <hi>London, Douer, Portsmouth, South-hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Bristoll, Excester, Plymouth, Ipswich, Linne, Yarmouth, Hull, Yorke, Newcastle, Chester, Lerpoole,</hi> and <hi>Hauer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> west, and in all the Shire Townes of the Realme. And to the intent the said Magazins, may be stored with conuenient prouision of Corne; His Maiestie is pleased, that it shall, and may bee law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to and for any the Merchants, or other the Subiects of this his Realme, to import from forraine parts such quantities of Corne, as to them shall seeme good, to be stored, and laid vp in the said Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins, paying to his Maiestie onely the Customes and Subsidies due for the same, according to the present Booke of rates, as hath beene heretofore accustomed to be paid, and no otherwise.</p>
            <p>And further, that all and euery person, and persons shall, and may, buy and prouide within this Realme, for the storing, and furnishing of the said Magazins, such quantities of English Corne, as to them shall seeme good, at such times onely, as the most vsuall prices of English Wheate shall bee, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thirtie two shillings the quarter, English Rie vnder eighteene shillings the quarter, and English Barley vnder sixteene shillings the quarter, respectiuely, in the Counties where the same shall vee bought and prouided. And for the better incouragement of such, as shall aduenture in the said Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazins, His Maiestie is well pleased, that all such forraine Corne, as shall be thither brought, may be freely sold and transported into any the parts beyond the Seas, being in League, or Amitie with his Maiestie, so as, at the time of such transportation, the rate and most vsuall price of English Corne in the three next adiacent Counties vnto the said Magazins, whence such transportation shalbe, doe not exceed fortie shillings the quarter of Wheate; twentie sixe shillings eight pence the quarter of Rie, and twentie shillings the quarter of Barley, respectiuely. But whensoeuer the said seuerall prices of Corne shall exceed the rates last aboue mentioned, then all forraine Corne shall bee stored and kept within the said Magazins, and shall bee sold and vented onely within this Realme, for the prouision of the same, and not else where.</p>
            <p>And when as the most vsuall rate of English Corne shall be vnder thirty two shillings the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Wheate, eighteene shillings the quarter of Rye, and sixeteene shillings the quarter of Barley; Then no forraine Corne shall bee solde within this Realme, for any other purpose and intent, but onely to bee stored, and laid vp in the said Magazins, or to bee transported into the parts beyond the seas, as aforesaid, (paying the due customes and subsidies for the English Corne) to the intent, the price of English Corne may bee held vp, at some fitting proportion, for the benefit of the Farmor, and Husbandman, and that such Corne, so to bee transported, may produce, and returne a proportion of Coyne, for the replenishing of the Treasure of this Kingdome. And his Maiesties pleasure is, that no person, or persons, doing any thing according to the tenour of this his Royall Proclamation, shall bee therefore troubled, molested, or disquieted, by any action, suite, or information, vpon any Law, or Statute touching the ingrossing, or transporting of Corne, or other penall Law to that purpose made; His Maiestie in his grace and fauour to his Subiects, and for the publique good, being conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to dispence with the penalties, and forfeitures thereof, in all the particulars aboue mentioned; but against all other offenders, not hereby dispenced with, the said Lawes, and Statutes shall be put in exact execution. And his further pleasure is, that all such forraine Corne, for which the dueties first aboue mentioned, shall be paid vpon importation thereof, shall bee freed from the payment of any Custome, Subsidie, or Impost, whensoeuer the same shall bee againe exported by the first importer thereof, or by any other person, whether the property thereof bee altered, or not altered before the exportation thereof. And for auoiding all deceit, and abuse, contrary to the true meaning hereof, His Maiesties will and pleasure is, That no Corne hereafter be transported as forreine Corne, but vpon oath made in the Custome-house of the port, out of which the same shall bee transported, that the same Corne did not grow within this Realme: And that exact Registers, and bookes bee kept in euery seuerall Port, of all Corne, aswell imported, as exported, and of the seuerall quantities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and how much thereof is forraine, and how much English Corne, and by whom the same shall be either imported, or exported, and this to bee done freely without any fee or charge for doing thereof. And that it shall clearely appeare, that His Maiesties intention herein, is onely the good of His Subiects, His Maiesties expresse pleasure, and command is, that all Iustices of Peace, in euery of the seuerall Shires of the Kingdome, shall haue speciall care, that in case any abuse, or inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence shall grow by any of these Magazins, then presently to aduertise the Lords of His Maiesties Priuie Councell thereof, that present redresse may be of any inconuenience that shall happen.</p>
